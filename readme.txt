Custom Contact Forms is a plugin for handling and displaying custom web forms [customcontact form=1] in any page, post, category, or archive in which you want the form to show. This plugin allows you to create fields with a variety of options and to attach them to specific forms you create; definitely allows for more customization than any other Wordpress Contact Form plugin; comes with a customizable captcha spam blocker! Also comes with a web form widget to drag-and-drop in to your sidebar.
