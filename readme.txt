== Installation ==
1. Upload to /wp-content/plugins
2. Activate the plugin from your Wordpress Admin Panel
3. Configure the plugin, create fields, and create forms in the Settings page called Custom Contact Forms
4. Display those forms in posts and pages by inserting the code: __[customcontact form=FORMID]__
5. In the instruction section of the plugin. Press the button to insert the default content. The default content contains a very generic form that will help you understand the many ways you can use Custom Contact Forms.

== Configuring and Using the Plugin ==
1. Create as many forms as you want.
2. Create fields and attach those fields to the forms of your choice. Attach the fields in the order that you want them to show up in the form. If you mess up you can detach and reattach them.
3. Display those forms in posts and pages by inserting the code: __[customcontact form=FORMID]__. Replace __FORMID__ with the id listed to the left of the form slug next to the form of your choice above. You can also __display forms in theme files__; the code for this is provided within each forms admin section.
4. Prevent spam by attaching the fixed field, captcha or ishuman. Captcha requires users to type in a number shown on an image. Ishuman requires users to check a box to prove they aren't a spam bot.
5. Add a form to your sidebar, by dragging the Custom Contact Form reusable widget in to your sidebar.
6. Configure the General Settings appropriately; this is important if you want to receive your web form messages!
7. Create form styles to change your forms appearances. The image below explains how each style field can change the look of your forms.
8. (advanced) If you are confident in your HTML and CSS skills, you can use the Custom HTML Forms feature as a framework and write your forms from scratch. This allows you to use this plugin simply to process your form requests. The Custom HTML Forms feature will process and email any form variables sent to it regardless of whether they are created in the fields manager.

Custom Contact Forms is an extremely intuitive plugin allowing you to create any type of contact form you can image. CCF is very user friendly but with possibilities comes complexity. __It is recommend that you click the button in the instructions section of the plugin to add default fields, field options, and forms.__ The default content will help you get a feel for the amazing things you can accomplish with this plugin. __It is also recommended you click the "Show Plugin Usage Popover"__ in the instruction area of the admin page to read in detail about all parts of the plugin.
