Fixed Fields do special things that you wouldn't be able to accomplish with normally; they cannot be deleted or created. If you use the fixedEmail field, as opposed to creating your own email field. the users email will be checked to make sure it is valid, if it isn't a form error will be displayed."

"                            If you are importing without using the built-in importer (such as PHPMyAdmin), then note the following: You should only run the import file on Wordpress installations that already have Custom Contact Forms installed; also you will need to change the table prefix for each query within the .SQL file."
