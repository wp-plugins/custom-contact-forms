"Import/export is a new feature that allows you to transfer forms, fields, field options, styles and everything else saved by the plugin between Wordpress installations. Clicking the Export All button will create a .SQL file for download. With the .SQL export file you can use the importer within the CCF plugin admin page to import the .SQL file. The built-in importer is completely safe as long as you only import files that have been generated by the CCF exporter. \n"

"                            If you are importing without using the built-in importer (such as PHPMyAdmin), then note the following: You should only run the import file on Wordpress installations that already have Custom Contact Forms installed; also you will need to change the table prefix for each query within the .SQL file."
